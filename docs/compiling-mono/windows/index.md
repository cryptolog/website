To build Mono on Windows, a Cygwin setup is required. You'll also need Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2015 Build Tools for command line builds. Visual Studio 2017 is also supported.

**NOTE**, below instructions apply to Cygwin. If WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is used instead of Cygwin, corresponding packages needs to be installed into WSL environment.

It is possible to build Mono runtime and BCL using Visual Studio without any prerequisites on Cygwin or WSL environment, see [build Mono without Cygwin or WSL](/docs/compiling-mono/windows/no-cygwin/) for details.

**NOTE**, for full build and execution of tests, a Cygwin or WSL environment is still needed as outlined below.

## Install prerequisites

* Enable `Developer Mode` in the Windows 10 Settings app (Update & Security -> For developers tab)
* Download and install 64 bit Cygwin from [www.cygwin.com](http://www.cygwin.com).
* Install [Visual Studio 2015 or later](https://www.visualstudio.com) - Community Edition works fine.
* Download and install [Mono for Windows](/docs/getting-started/install/windows/) or use `monolite` build step as described below.
* Run the following command in cmd.exe to install Cygwin and required packages:

```bash
setup-x86_64.exe -P autoconf,automake,bison,gcc-core,gcc-g++,mingw64-i686-runtime,mingw64-i686-binutils,mingw64-i686-gcc-core,mingw64-i686-gcc-g++,mingw64-i686-pthreads,mingw64-i686-w32api,mingw64-x86_64-runtime,mingw64-x86_64-binutils,mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core,mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++,mingw64-x86_64-pthreads,mingw64-x86_64-w32api,libtool,make,python,gettext-devel,gettext,intltool,libiconv,pkg-config,git,curl,wget,libxslt,bc,patch,cmake,perl,yasm
```

Make sure that the following GIT setting is used to avoid issues with line endings:

`git config --global core.autocrlf input`

## Building Mono from a Release Package

Mono releases are distributed as .tar.bz2 packages from the Mono web site. Once you have your dependencies installed all you need to do is run the following command where `VERSION` is the package version number and `PREFIX` is your installation prefix (see below for details):

```bash
PREFIX=[mono installation location]
VERSION=[mono package version]
tar xvf mono-$VERSION.tar.bz2
cd mono-$VERSION
```

## Building Mono from GIT

Another alternative is to clone Mono repository directly from GitHub, `PREFIX` is you Mono installation location (see below for details):

``` bash
PREFIX=[mono installation location]
PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
git clone https://github.com/mono/mono.git
cd mono
```

## Pre-configured build instructions

Pre-configured build instructions, building a default Visual Studio Mono runtime, mingw Mono runtime, Mono BCL and install into `$PREFIX`. For further detailed build configurations and instructions, see next section. Run one of the following set of commands from a Cygwin command prompt after all steps above have been completed.

64-bit Mono runtime using SGEN GC and default BCL profile (net_4_x):
```bash
./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --with-msvc --disable-boehm
make -j4
make install
```

32-bit Mono runtime using SGEN GC and default BCL profile (net_4_x):
```bash
./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX --host=i686_64-w64-mingw32 --with-msvc --disable-boehm
make -j4
make install
```

## Detailed build instructions

If one of the pre-configured build instructions doesn't match configuration needs, this section outline detailed step by step build instructions. First step is to configure build and last step to install build into `$PREFIX` where a Mono distribution already exists (replacing existing build on install). **NOTE**, to keep existing Mono distribution untouched, setup a different `$PREFIX` where the new build will be installed.

It is also possible to only set `PATH` to point to an existing Mono distribution without specify `$PREFIX` but then `make install` won't work as expected.

Another option is to build without an existing pre-installed Mono distribution, see section related to `monolite` for more details or configure a Visual Studio build Mono runtime in `MONO_EXECUTABLE` environment variable.

The following configure steps shows different supported Mono build configurations.

64-bit Mono runtime using SGEN GC and default BCL profile (net_4_x). The Boehm GC is not supported on 64-bit Windows build:

```bash
./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --disable-boehm
```

32-bit Mono runtime using SGEN GC and default BCL profile (net_4_x):

```bash
./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --disable-boehm
```

32-bit Mono runtime using Boehm GC and default BCL profile (net_4_x):

```bash
./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX --host=i686-w64-mingw32
```

**NOTE**, 32-bit Mono runtime supports both SGEN and Boehm GC. Boehm GC is still available for legacy reasons but not supported on 64-bit Windows builds. It is recommended to use SGEN GC for both 32 and 64-bit Windows builds.

### Enable BTLS as cryptographic backend for Windows builds.

Mono on Windows supports BTLS library as an alternative cryptographic backend for SSL/TLS. It is not the default alternative and must be enabled to build and be used by Mono runtime. To enable BTLS, pass `--enable-btls` to the `./autogen.sh` step above.

BTLS build will add a couple of additional prerequisites for Visual Studio builds. The easiest way to get additional needed packages is to install and use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager. See https://chocolatey.org/install for instructions on how to install Chocolatey package manager into the build system.

Once Chocolatey has been installed, add the following packages to the build system:

```cmd
choco install cmake
choco install perl
choco install ninja
choco install yasm
```

Make sure they are all visible to the build environment used by Visual Studio (restart any command prompts or Visual Studio IDE's used in the build).

### Use monolite instead of pre-installed Mono distribution.

If no Mono distribution is available, you can build using `monolite`. Just run the command below before running `make`:

```bash
make get-monolite-latest
```

## Build Mono using Visual Studio

The native runtime libraries can be built using Visual Studio and msbuild. However, the .NET libraries and tests must currently be built in Cygwin using `make`. The steps below describe how to build the runtime libraries in Visual Studio and use the Visual Studio built Mono executable when building the class libraries and tests as well as running the test suites in Cygwin.

### Build 64-bit Mono using Visual Studio

Open the Mono solution `msvc\mono.sln` in Visual Studio IDE. Rebuild the solution using Release|x64 solution configuration. For command line build, see below.

### Build 32-bit Mono using Visual Studio

Open the Mono solution `msvc\mono.sln` in Visual Studio IDE. Rebuild the solution using Release|Win32 solution configuration. For command line build, see below.

### Build Mono from Visual Studio command line

Instead of building from within Visual Studio IDE you can run `msbuild.exe` directly from the command line. It is recommended to run the build from a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt to get a correctly setup build environment.

For Visual Studio 2015: Run `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat` from command prompt used in build or launch new command prompt using ´Developer Command Prompt for VS2015´ from start menu (if installed).

For Visual Studio 2017: Run `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat` from the command prompt used in build or launch new command prompt using ´Developer Command Prompt for VS2017´ from start menu (if installed).

There is also a build script that can be used to setup a correct build environment and run msbuild.exe, `msvc\run-msbuild.bat`. The script selects Visual Studio version based on `VisualStudioVersion` environment variable, 14.0 == Visual Studio 2015, 15.0 == Visual Studio 2017.

```cmd
msvc\run-msbuild.bat "/p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /p:MONO_TARGET_GC=sgen /t:Build"
```

**NOTE**, paths to installed Visual Studio files could be different depending on install location and Visual Studio edition.

Example of a Visual Studio 2015 32-bit Mono runtime release build using SGEN GC:

```cmd
msbuild.exe /p:PlatformToolset=v140 /p:Platform=Win32 /p:Configuration=Release /p:MONO_TARGET_GC=sgen msvc/mono.sln
```

Example of a Visual Studio 2015 64-bit Mono runtime release build using SGEN GC:

```cmd
msbuild.exe /p:PlatformToolset=v140 /p:Platform=x64 /p:Configuration=Release /p:MONO_TARGET_GC=sgen msvc/mono.sln
```

Example of a Visual Studio 2017 32-bit Mono runtime release build using SGEN GC:

```cmd
msbuild.exe /p:PlatformToolset=v141 /p:Platform=Win32 /p:Configuration=Release /p:MONO_TARGET_GC=sgen msvc/mono.sln
```

Example of a Visual Studio 2017 64-bit Mono runtime release build using sgen GC:

```cmd
msbuild.exe /p:PlatformToolset=v141 /p:Platform=x64 /p:Configuration=Release /p:MONO_TARGET_GC=sgen msvc/mono.sln
```

**NOTE**, while it is possible to run msbuild from Cygwin environment it is not recommended since the build might pick up build tools and dependencies from Cygwin instead of Windows environment. There is however a build script `msvc/run-msbuild.sh` that can be called from Cygwin that will try to isolate the environment when running msbuild command.

### Configure `make` to use Visual Studio build Mono runtime.

For make to use Visual Studio build Mono runtime when building BCL and test, set `MONO_EXECUTABLE` environment variable to Visual Studio build Mono runtime. Switch to the Cygwin shell previously used and run:

```bash
export MONO_EXECUTABLE=/cygdrive/c/mono-source-location/msvc/build/sgen/x64/bin/Release/mono-sgen.exe
```

**NOTE**, above path will change depending on source location, build location, 32/64-bit build configuration and used GC. The example above uses the default build location for a 64-bit release build Mono runtime configured to use SGEN GC.

## Build Mono mingw runtime, BCL and Tests.

Switch to the Cygwin shell previously used and run:

```bash
make -j4
```

**NOTE**, the mingw build Mono runtime will still be built even if a Visual Studio build Mono runtime has been build and configured. The mingw runtime will however not be used as part of the BCL or test builds when `MONO_EXECUTABLE` has been configured.

#### Known Issue: "failed to create symbolic link"

If you run `make V=1` and see this after a successful BCL build:

```bash
make[8]: Entering directory '/home/user/work/mono/mcs/class/corlib'
CYGWIN=winsymlinks:nativestrict ln -s /home/user/work/mono/mcs/class/lib/build-win32 /home/user/work/mono/mcs/class/lib/build
ln: failed to create symbolic link '/home/user/work/mono/mcs/class/lib/build': Operation not permitted
make[8]: *** [../../build/library.make:336: ../../class/lib/build/.stamp] Error 1
```

you need to enable `Developer Mode` in the Windows 10 Settings app (Update & Security -> For developers tab) which will allow your user to create symbolic links without administrator privileges.

If you use an earlier Windows versions, you need to run the build as administrator.

## Run all tests

Make sure `MONO_EXECUTABLE` has been setup to use Visual Studio build Mono runtime, see above for instructions. For all tests to run and pass, the Cygwin shell will need elevated permissions. Without additional permissions, some test failures will be identified. 

```bash
make check
```

## Install build

```bash
make install
```
